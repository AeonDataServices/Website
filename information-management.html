				<h1>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</h1>
				<p>AEONDS have worked within the information management sector for the last decade, covering the wide range of deliverables and expertise within the field from data quality, system implementation to large scale reporting and analytics. Our teams have a multidisciplinary approach that combines digital construction expertise with data science and software development to guarantee that we deliver high quality results based on the dynamic needs of your projects. </p>
	      <p>Core information management services</p>
	      <p>Our services focus on digital construction delivery throughout the entire lifecycle of a project, broken down into three core competencies, project initialisation, reporting and handover services.</p>
	      <p>Project Initialisation Services</p>
	      <p>Handover is often left as a final checkbox once the final phases of construction and commissioning are nearing their completion, rather than front-loaded effort that kicks off at design. A majority of the issues during handover can often be mitigated by an experienced information management team developing the correct plans, processes and procedures, which then enables a progressive handover, rather than a massive end of project task.</p>
	      <p>Electronic Document Management Systems</p>
	      <p>Our team has experience of over 15 of the industry leading EDMS at an administrator and developer level, which is a critical component to any major project and effective management of digital information. Our services cover the following areas of an EDMS implementation: 
	      	<li>Entire project level set-up and development.</li>
	      	<li>Subject matter expert training, development and delivery.</li>
	      	<li>Project team training based on needs/use case assessment.</li>
	      	<li>Core metadata requirements for all stakeholders at multiple levels, client, contractor and sub-contractor.</li>
	      	<li>Full deliverable pre-population at early project stage to enable accurate and clear reporting.</li>
	      	<li>Standardised workflows based on industry best practice.</li>
	      </p>
	      <p>Document Management Plans</p>
	      <p>Our team has experience authoring, reviewing, approving and implementing document management across largescale projects. We understand client needs, your requirements and translate them into effective processes and procedures for the execution of the project. To do this we: 
		      <li>Fully author the Document Management Plan against client requirements and coordinate the review and approval process.</li>
		      <li>Breakdown core EDMS requirements, hard, softcopy requirements and handover processes within the plan.</li>
		      <li>Provide visual workflows to convey the project processes concisely.</li>
	      </p>
	      <p>Master Deliverable Index, Handover Index and Handover coordination</p>
	      <p>Understanding delivery of information is core to holding vendors, suppliers and subcontractors accountable for handover. Getting these processes in place and executed during the early phases of the project guarantees a low-effort handover and visible accountability.  To mitigate late delivery and overdue handover risk we: 
		      <li>Initiate the Master Deliverable Index (MDI) and Handover indexes (HOI) and develop them continually as parallel actions from the outset of the project.</li>
		      <li>Coordinate with the subcontractors to populate and develop the MDI to ensure full visibility and understanding across the board.</li>
		      <li>Integrate with the commissioning teams to project and support the commissioning documentation and its handover.</li>
		      <li>Coordinating the handover, including tracking of all PDF and native deliverables across numerous systems and into the client's repositories.</li>
	      </p>
	      <p>Reporting</p>
	      <p>Alongside our services to set up the information management systems for your projects, we have the expertise to provide daily, weekly and monthly core reporting at different stakeholder levels. We leverage our expertise with industry leading EDMS systems, APIs and our in-house programming and data science teams to create a seamless live reporting system. As a basic service we deliver: 
		      <li>Live documentation dashboards for the project, dimensioned by any metric required.</li>
		      <li>Three breakdown levels tailored to the specific stakeholder audience youâ€™re addressing.</li>
		      <li>Intelligent analytics to pin-point potential risk factors in delivery and mitigate high impact delays.</li>
